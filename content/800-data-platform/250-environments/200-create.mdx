<TopBlock>

For any project in the Prisma Data Platform, you can create multiple [environments](/data-platform/environments) and associate each with a different database and a different Data Proxy region.

You can use environments to isolate database development activities with separate branches and databases, and dedicate each environment to an activity, such as Development, Staging, Production, and so on.

</TopBlock>

## Prerequisites

- You are the [Project owner](/data-platform/members/user-roles) or have the [Admin](/data-platform/members/user-roles) role for the project to create a new environment.
- Obtain a database connection string for the new environment.
- Based on your [project plan quota](/data-platform/billing/plans-and-quotas), check if you have capacity for more environments.

## Steps

1. From the **Environments** drop-down menu, select **Create new environment**.

2. In **Environment name**, enter a name for the environment.

   **Note**<br /><br />
   Use any naming convention that makes sense for your project.<br /><br />
   If applicable, you can use the Staging, Development, or &lt;Feature name&gt; conventions to dedicate an environment to a database development workflow or to the development of a specific feature.

   </Admonition>

3. In **Connection string**, paste the database connection string for the new environment.
4. (Optional) From **Static IPs**, select **Enabled** if your database is behind a firewall and you can only configure external access from specific IP addresses. Copy the IP addresses and add them to the allowlist of your database.

   **Note**<br /><br />

   For more information, see [Static egress IP address](/data-platform/static-ips).

   </Admonition>
5. Under **Data Proxy**, from the **Location** drop-down menu, select the geographic location for the Data Proxy.

   <Admonition>

   **Note**<br /><br />

   Select a Data Proxy location that is close to the geographic location of the database for the new environment.<br /><br />
   If you select a location that is geographically distant from the database, then when your application sends requests to the database through the Data Proxy, you might notice some delay in the responses.

   </Admonition>
<Admonition type="alert">

   **Important**<br /><br />

   After you create an environment, you cannot change its Data Proxy location. You can select a different Data Proxy location only when you create a new environment.

   </Admonition>

6. Click **Create environment**.

     alt="Prisma Data Platform - Create environment - Name environment, enter a database connection string, select Data Proxy region, enable firewalled connection via static IPs to your database"
     width="450px"
   />

## Result

The environment is added to the project and appears in the **Environments** drop-down menu.

After the platform creates the environment, your browser is redirected to the **Data Browser** for the new environment.

## What's next

You can switch between the environments of a project from the **Environments** drop-down menu in the upper left (next to the **Projects** drop-down).

- After you switch to a different environment, the **Data Browser** and **Query Console** use the database and Data Proxy location configured that the environment.
- What **Schema Viewer** shows differs depending on whether your database is empty or contains some models
   - If your database was empty when you created the project, **Schema Viewer** does not show a schema and invites you to link a GitHub repository with the Prisma schema for your project.
   - If your database had models when you created the project, **Schema Viewer** shows the introspected Prisma schema at the bottom (which you can refresh) and invites you to link a GitHub repository with the Prisma schema for your project so that the platform can keep your schema up-to-date.
