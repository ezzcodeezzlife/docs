## Overview

In the Prisma Data Platform, the **Schema Viewer** tab shows the contents of the Prisma schema file for the currently selected environment of a Prisma project.

If you select another environment which uses a separate branch or repository, the **Schema Viewer** tab shows the schema file from that branch or repository.

The **Schema Viewer** tab also shows the last time when the schema file was pulled from the repository in the `Last pulled from GitHub 9 days ago` line. The Prisma Data Platform updates the schema file contents as soon at it detects a change in the repository.

## Provide a Prisma schema

If you created your project without enabling schema synchronization, you can do so in the **Schema Viewer**.

### Steps

1. From **GitHub Account**, select a GitHub account or organization.
2. From **Repository**, select a repository.
3. From **Branch**, select the branch that you want to use for the currently selected environment.
4. (Optional) If you have a non-default path for your Prisma schema, define that in **Prisma schema path**.
5. Click **Link Prisma schema**.
